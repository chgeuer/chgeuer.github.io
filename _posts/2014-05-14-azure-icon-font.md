Under [azure-iconography](https://github.com/chgeuer/azure-iconography), you can find an icon font, usable for the web, which is based on the [Microsoft Azure icon set](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41937). I hope it is helpful when you blog about Microsoft Azure, as it includes all the symbols Microsoft provided. 

For example, you can talk about web sites (<i class="icon wa-web-sites"></i>) or media services (<i class="icon wa-media-services"></i>).

For a full overview to the icons, check the [reference sheet](/pages/azure-iconography-reference.html).
