> TL;DR - When you generate QR codes which contain sensitive (confidential) information, do *not* use an external service to render the QR code images, but by all means, do it yourself. All your future users will thank you for not leaking their most important long-term credential. 

## the basics

Yesterday, I tried 2-factor authentication (2FA) using the [Windows Phone Authenticator](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/authenticator/e7994dbc-2336-4950-91ba-ca22d653759b) app, and wondered how the overall system worked: Basically, it is an implementation of the [RFC6238 - TOTP: Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) spec, which takes the UNIX epoch time in seconds modulo 30, and uses the rounded seconds and a symmetric key to derive a time based hash, and takes some bits from the resulting hash as integer-based PIN. 

For UX reasons, the symmetric key is imported into the Authenticator app via a QR code. The content of the QR code is a URI like ```otpauth://totp/Microsoft:user%40outlook.com?secret=AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD```. In this sample, the string ```Microsoft:user%40outlook.com``` is a textual identifier of the symmetric key (without any cryptographic significance), and the string ```AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD``` is the symmetric (secret, i.e. highly sensitive and confidential!!!) key, in [BASE32 encoding](http://www.crockford.com/wrmg/base32.html), i.e. just case-insensitive text and decimal digits. The QR code, displayed on screen once, and scanned by the mobile phone app, is a convenient and ephemeral mechanism to securely transfer the credential. 

## the problem

Looking for a sample, I found the cool [ASPNETIdentity_GoogleAuthenticator](https://github.com/beabigrockstar/ASPNETIdentity_GoogleAuthenticator) demo, which shows how to leverage 2FA in an ASP.NET app. The only bummer I found was the [view which displayed the QR code](https://github.com/beabigrockstar/ASPNETIdentity_GoogleAuthenticator/blob/067873f2aa7bfb3e0309e9f125cc3429b0b20932/ASPNETIdentity_GoogleAuthenticator/Views/Manage/EnableGoogleAuthenticator.cshtml): 

```HTML
<div class="col-md-4"> 
     <img src="http://qrcode.kaywa.com/img.php?s=4&d=@(Model.BarcodeUrl)"/> 
</div> 
```

To display the QR code with the embedded cryptographic key to the user, the sample used an external service to render the confidential URI. Drilling a bit deeper, the [ASPNETIdentity_GoogleAuthenticator](https://github.com/beabigrockstar/ASPNETIdentity_GoogleAuthenticator) uses the [OtpSharp NuGet package](https://bitbucket.org/devinmartin/otp-sharp/), and there, it [was again](https://bitbucket.org/devinmartin/otp-sharp/src/2820254eb66d6b04361655580d8d2c9f75960198/GoogleAuthenticatorTotpTest/GoogleAuthenticatorTotpTest.cs?at=default): 

```csharp
private void ResetTotp()
{
    this.totp = new Totp(rfcKey, this.stepSize, totpSize: this.digits);
    var name = this.textBoxKeyLabel.Text;
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(name)) name = "OtpSharp@test.com";

    string url = KeyUrl.GetTotpUrl(rfcKey, name, step: this.stepSize, totpSize: this.digits);
    this.pictureBox1.ImageLocation = string.Format("http://qrcode.kaywa.com/img.php?s=4&d={0}", HttpUtility.UrlEncode(url));
}
```

The QR code contains (by design) the probably most sensitive information a user has: the cryptographic long-term key for a proof-of-possession token. The previous use of an external site for rendering sensitive QR codes has multiple problems: 

- The app forces the user's browser to send the credential (the query string for the QR code generator) across an unencrypted (http) connection. 
- The site (qrcode.kaywa.com) has no security relationship with the sample code. It cannot be trusted. 
- The HTTP GET operations are most certainly stored long-term in the qrcode.kaywa.com web site logs. Whoever is behind the kaywa.com domain in ZÃ¼rich, I'm sure they have plenty of keys in their web server logs now. Hmmm, yummie. 

*Don't do that* :-/. Don't get me wrong: I'm not saying qrcode.kaywa.com is evil. I am just saying "do not use some random 3rd party service for generating security-critical QR codes".

## one possible solution

For pure browser-based QR code generation, a quick search surfaced two JavaScript libraries, [neocotic/qr.js](https://github.com/neocotic/qr.js/) (which is GPL3 licensed) and [davidshimjs/qrcodejs](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs/) (which is MIT licensed). In the [QRCodeInHTML](https://github.com/chgeuer/QRCodeInHTML) repository, I played around with generating QR codes purely in a web app. You can try it out [here](/code/qr/).
